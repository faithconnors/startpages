# startpages
A collection of Startpages, made or editted by me for myself and others.


Startpages are a great way to customize your experience with your computer. You open up your web browser of choice, and instead of being greeted by that bright, bland Google screen that you are probably using as your home page, you'll have your own little directory of links and actions that are readily available. So instead of typing in "facebook" on Google, you can just click the link you put on your startpage.

But not only is it more efficient, it's more visually appealing. You come home from a long day at work, sit down at your PC, you have a mild headache, and when you open your browser everything is just so bright. It's awful, and it emphasizes the headache you have. Well with a startpage now you have a darker theme, everything is in one place, it looks a lot prettier and it's just easier on the eyes. You know where everything is because you put it there yourself so you can browse more efficiently than before, saving you some extra time typing stuff into search bars or trying to navigate through your list of bookmarks.

To install a startpage, first see how it looks in your web browser to see if you need any edits.
Either open up the .HTML file in your web browser or simply drag it into the browser itself to open the file.
If everything looks nice and works for you, you can install it!

1. Open your browser settings
2. Find your home page settings
3. Instead of Google as your home page, point the URL to the file on your computer. It should look like: "file:///C:/[PATH]" where the [PATH] is the path to the .HTML file.

3.1. Optional, but you can also set your new tab page to your start page.
4. Save your settings and hit the Home button.
